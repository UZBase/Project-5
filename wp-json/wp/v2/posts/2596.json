I got a chance to be interviewed and answer questions on all things lashes. Let&#8217;s dive in to the world of lashes with the article below. To read my full interview please go to and click on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/coveteur.com\/2020\/08\/13\/false-eyelash-extensions-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\">Coveteur.com here<\/a>. And don&#8217;t forget to browse all Coveteur articles on all things beauty and style. They have the best website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If there\u2019s one thing that every beauty guru knows, it\u2019s that a fluttery lash can take&nbsp;any makeup look to the next level. While some of us have been truly blessed with long, curly lashes\u2014I\u2019m talking to the men here, too\u2014the rest of us tend to need multiple swipes of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coveteur.com\/2020\/08\/06\/makeup-artists-lengthening-mascaras\/\">most volumizing and lengthening mascara<\/a>&nbsp;we can get our hands on. At times that may seem like enough, but when your eyelashes are so short that even the most expensive mascara and curler on the market don\u2019t do the trick, what are you left to do? Luckily there are plenty of products and services that offer a solution to our stubby lash problem, from&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coveteur.com\/2020\/07\/21\/sahara-lotti-deskside\/\">oils and serums<\/a>&nbsp;to extensions and falsies\u2014there&nbsp;<em>is<\/em>&nbsp;hope for us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you\u2019re anything like me, you might not have the slightest clue where to begin. You could give growth formulas a try, but what if you want instant results? This is where falsies or fake eyelashes come into play.<strong> False eyelashes and extensions<\/strong> can give you the ultra-long lash look you\u2019ve been eager to achieve. For the experienced beauty guru, getting lash extensions or putting on falsies can be a cakewalk. However, if you\u2019re a newbie to the lash life, it can seem very challenging and a tad bit confusing. Take it from me, someone who wore costume makeup for dance competitions for\u00a0<em>years\u2014<\/em>I couldn\u2019t put my own eyelashes on to save my life. Luckily, I had the chance to speak with \u201cthe pioneer of eyelash extensions,\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dlashes\/#\">Dionne Phillips<\/a>, owner of\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dlashes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">D\u2019Lashes Luxury Eyelash Extension Spa<\/a>. The L.A.-based lash artist shared her insights on navigating the lash space for beginners along with expert tips and tricks on how to put on falsies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>For a newbie to the lash game, where would you have them start?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSince the days of COVID with the pandemic, it\u2019s all about the mask and your eyes. People are wanting to add some drama or a little bit more texture and contrast to the eyes now. If people are comfortable coming in and laying down for extensions, I would recommend a classic, basic, natural look to the first-time wearer. [If they\u2019re not comfortable coming in,] I would have them start with strip lashes, or falsies, in a very light, pretty,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/shop.dlashes.com\/dwispy-lashes\/\">wispy<\/a>&nbsp;style. They\u2019re very natural and basic but still give that pop and extra contrast that they are looking for.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What is the process for a basic lash extension?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith doing basic lash extensions, I use classic extended-wear lashes. They\u2019re one single silk fiber attached to one individual micro hair, and it\u2019s called an anagen. They are attached to one of your lash hairs one at a time.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What about falsies? Do you have any special tricks for applying them?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[Falsies] come on a band or a spine\u2014consider it a band of lashes. They often come in different variations, lengths, and thickness. In the past there were just flat strip lashes and it didn\u2019t offer much depth to them. Now they have&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/shop.dlashes.com\/3d-soft-dwispy-lashes\/\">multi-level lashes<\/a>&nbsp;along with lash clusters that have about three layers of lashes that emulate lash extensions. So if you can\u2019t get to your lash extension service or want to see how you\u2019d look with fuller extensions before going to the salon, I would definitely give these a try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe biggest trick is letting the adhesive glue dry, getting it a little tacky for about 13 seconds. Where a lot of beginners mess up is applying the lash too soon, when the glue is still wet. Blow on the lash and fan it with your applicator or your finger, whatever way you find to be more comfortable when applying them. Most glues have a blue indicator that will let you know; once it turns completely white, it\u2019s more tacky. Now you\u2019re ready to apply. With a magnifying mirror, I recommend to start by placing it right in the middle of your eye while adding slight pressure. Then pressing it down towards your nose but not going beyond your brow so it\u2019s even and it\u2019s not hanging off your eye\u2014giving your eye a relatively droopy look. Hold it like that for about 20 to 30 seconds to make sure it\u2019s in place. Also, pre-measure your lashes before applying glue and make sure they fit the length of your eye.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Original article is from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/LET\u2019S TALK FALSIES: A BEGINNER\u2019S GUIDE TO LASHES Fluttery eyelashes right this way.
